# smash

## About
This project consisted of creating a Small Shell (SmaSh) Program that parses user input and performs actions on the machine such as file system changes, and spawning processes. Other features supported by smash are variables, piping, forking, and scripting.
The project is written entirely in stdlib C with the exception of [Linenoise](https://github.com/antirez/linenoise) which simplifies handling of user input.
